# JBoss Animated Logo

As the name suggests, JBoss Animated Logo aims to develop creative animated logos
for JBoss Website as well as Mobile Application.

You are suggested to go through the following link to get an idea about what we are
trying to develop. JBoss Animated Logo Sample

You are expected to develop an Animated Logo either by using web development tools
like CSS and animation libraries such as anime js, mo js or you can use mobile
development tools like the mobile animation tools. Originality and creativity will be
appreciated.

After developing your logo, you are requested to create a folder containing all the
necessary files along with the README.md file containing the GIF or the short video link.
The folder name should follow a pattern as:

```
 For Mobile Apps based logos - For_Mobile/<your_name>
 For Web Apps based logos - For_Web/<your_name>
```
Please send a PR with the name
as <your_name>_For_Mobile_Logo or <your_name>_For_Web_Logo. Include a link (Google Drive
Link) to your final output(Short Video Clip/Screen Cast Video) in the PR message.
After reviewing all the logos, we may select one of them for our mobile and web
application splash screen.
